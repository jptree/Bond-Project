This view is unrelated to bond analysis. This was something I worked on (mainly out of boredom and curiosity) after
meeting with Cole. I am not sure if what mechanism is in place to extract merchant names from raw statements--but I hope
that this is an insightful example of what is possible!

This view will allow you to interact with a convolutional
neural network I trained on my own credit statements to extract merchant names from raw transaction strings. 
This is a scalable solution and will only get better with more data!
